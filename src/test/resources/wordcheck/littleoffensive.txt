A writer by the name of Jim Hogue penned an article for the website TheRichest a little while back entitled "15 Thoughts Every Guy Has When Dating a Bigger Woman." While you can't find the original article on the website anymore (likely due to pissed off readers), you can still find countless angry women posting about it all over the web. The ignorant, fat-shaming listicle has gems about a plus-sized woman's supposed superior ability to cook and her overwhelming desire to please. If there is one thing that can help quell your anger while reading this, it's that he was most likely fired immediately after receiving immense public backlash, seeing as how the article does not show up on TheRichest anymore and his most recent article for the site was published right before the "15 Thoughts" run date.
